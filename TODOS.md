## TODOS

- Pass in Lambda instance. Eliminates a direct dependency on vendor-specific libraries e.g AWS SDK. Will further make codebase lighter.
- Figure out how to return responses - when status code is success, and when an error is returned.
- Add unit tests.
- Do a manual test, install as an npm package and confirm it works.
